# IN4200
IN4200 â€“ High-Performance Computing and Numerical Projects

## Course content
In this course, you will learn about the basic concepts of parallel programming and high performance computing (high performance computing), as well as the most basic communication commands in MPI and OpenMP programming guidelines. Students will gain the knowledge they need to effectively use modern data architecture to solve computationally high-tech scientific issues. Such knowledge is necessary in all subjects within computer science. In this course you will learn about understanding in the development and use of digital systems. You learn about different systems, the needs of users, and the societal importance of the systems and you learn how systems are developed from a software engineering perspective.
